Sedrajs project uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) scripts to convert
[Sedra 3](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/about/resources) text file database
to a JavaScript representation.
[CAL ASCII](http://cal1.cn.huc.edu/searching/fullbrowser.html) transliteration
is used for Aramaic words and roots.

## Installation

In order to use this library, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) should be installed. 
Then run:
```
npm install sedrajs --save
```

Sedrajs files are not available for distribution, by design. Only the 
un-modified Sedra 3 database files and the conversion scripts are packaged.
You have to run the conversion scripts, by running the command above. That will
convert Sedra 3 text database and place it in your `node_modules` folder as:
* `sedra.esm.js` - An ES6 module bundle, suitable for use in other people's
libraries and applications.
* `sedra.js` - A general UMD build, suitable for use in any environment
(Web browser, Node.js, etc.)
* `sedra.min.js` - A minified version of `sedra.js` build.

        You are allowed to use SEDRA III for personal and academic
        purposes provided that:
        1. You do NOT redistribute any altered versions of the files.
        2. You do NOT redistribute any files for any kind of profit.
        3. You acknowledge in any publication whose results make use of
           SEDRA III, by any means, using a formula similar to the
           following:
          "This work makes use of the Syriac Electronic Data
           Retrieval Archive (SEDRA) by George A. Kiraz, distributed
           by the Syriac Computing Institute."
           You should also cite the paper mentioned above.
